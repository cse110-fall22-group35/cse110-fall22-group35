# Make application a multi page website

## Context and Problem Statement

What mode do we want our application?
What is the easiest and cleanest way to get our information accross?

## Considered Options

* Single page website
* Multi page website
* Web App

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Multi page website" because everyone working on the application was more comfortable working on a website than a web app. As well as it is an easier way to reach our target audience. We chose multi page because there was too much functionality to fit onto one page for what we want to accomplish.
