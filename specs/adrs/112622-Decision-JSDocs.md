# Generate documentation with JSDocs

## Context and Problem Statement

We need some way of creating documentation.
Nobody has any real experience creating documentation for Javascript.

## Considered Options

* Writing by hand
* JSDocs

## Decision Outcome

We chose to use JSDocs to create our documentation. Figuring out how to use it effectively with Github actions will take time, but overall it will be much easier than writing all of it by hand.
