b## Statement of Purpose

Giving people a way to review books and find new books to read

## Time Constraints

We have 4 or 5 weeks to get the project done with about 8 people. Due to this
we stringent on what features we are going to implement because we may not get everything
done. The main goal with this time constraint is starting with the most important things and
slowly working towards the smaller details as to not overwhelm us at the very beginning with
too much work.

## Risks and Rabbit Holes

- creating a database
  - limit our scope and slowly build it up
  - splitting up into teams so not everyone is stuck on it
- sorting and recommending books
- time period to do it
- making the css
  - having design meetings as a group so eveyone agrees what it will look like
- convoluted code
  - up-to-date documentation
  - code consistency in terms of variable names (e.g. camelStyle or snake_style), comments (e.g. use complete sentences), etc.
- navigation around the website
  - clear communication and planning
  - make a hierarchy of pages and start with the most important
  - CI: Continuous integration
  - Example:
    - 1st iteration (structure): homepage(html & css) -> individual books page(introduces database) -> add books page(database)
    - 2nd iteration (function): homepage(add links to individual books page, javascript) -> homepage(add search/filter feature)
    - 3rd iteartion (style): homepage(add style, css) -> individual books page(add style, css) -> add books page(add style, css)
    - nth iteration ...
- getting stuck on the small details
  - look at the big picture and slowly work on the smaller ones given time
  - Example:
    - structure (html, database) first, style/feature (css, search/filter) second;
    - local first, cloud second;

## No-Gos

- Do not start with recommender system
  - prioritize the ability to review books before we touch this
- Don't care about style in the beginning
  - prioritize functionality over looks
