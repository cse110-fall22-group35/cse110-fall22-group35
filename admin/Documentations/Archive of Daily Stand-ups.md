Averi Yu: 
 - Today, I finished adding a popular-authors recommended section with implemented photos in the front end.
 - I also added 50+ books images along with other trivial images that could be utilized for the data. 
 - To be more specific, I researched multiple databases, had setting up phpAdmin and php and mySQL files for remote storage, and coded bookstorage.js, localstoragedb.js, etc. I switched to local storage since the professor wants the local storage. I also modified the bookcards to make them correspond to the keys.
 - Today, I merge dev into main and worked on the search feature by trying to load a file.
 - Today, I successfully loaded 150+ books into the local storage (solo effort) after a long process of researching and working.
 - I merged main into dev. 
 - Besides, I discussed implementing sort/search feature procedures with Sam, commented out the reference database, and changed the front end with the home page books.
 - Today, I added the ratings for all books and allow users to enter ratings for books.
 - Today, I successfully develop the feature of clicking on the image loads the books that belong to the authors on the images (popular authors).
 - Today, I modified the home page and add-book.html to allow the home page to show the added books. Furthermore, I launch a refresh button to accompany the filter/sort/pop. authors feature. 
 - Today, I finished setting up phpMyAdmin locally intending to connect to a book database.
 - Today, I successfully loaded every book images to the database and connect them to the bookcards by myself. Besides, I align and beautify the bookcards by modifying the html & css specific to the book cards. 
 - Today, I helped the front end by updating HTML & CSS to make the pages more good-looking, including adjusting the book card size and alignment and adding really beautiful buttons and logos with animation effects to every page (design was changed due to the requests by Sarah). In addition, I found out bugs in CI/CD that is keep deleting wanted codes in css.
