## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
All members will be expected to **read all slack messages** from all team members. This includes, **answering questions, participating in conversations, and answering polls**.

## Scheduling Meetings
We will schedule **2, hour long meetings with our team and 1 with the TA per week**. With the stipulation that we will check in with the team on **slack** the days that we do not meet. 

## General Responsibilities for All Team Members
- Make sure everyone has their space and time to talk
- Give everyone basic respect
- Attend meeting or let the team know if you cannot

## Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines
TBD

## Conflict Resolution
**Have a whole team conversation** and discuss what is going on. **Elaborate on what the problem is** to see if we can come to a natural solution. If a whole group conversation does not work then there will be a **private conversation with the team leads**. If it cannot be resolved with the team leads it **will be taken to our TA and then Professor**.

## Expectations of Professor and TA’s
> If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
